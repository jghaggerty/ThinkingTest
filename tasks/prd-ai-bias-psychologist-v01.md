# Product Requirements Document: AI Bias Psychologist v0.1

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The AI Bias Psychologist v0.1 is a diagnostic tool that systematically detects, measures, and tracks cognitive biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) using structured behavioral probes inspired by Kahneman's research in judgment and decision-making. This tool addresses the critical need to understand and quantify how AI systems exhibit human-like cognitive biases, which can lead to systematic errors in reasoning, decision-making, and output generation. Unlike human bias testing, this system must account for the unique characteristics of generative AI systems while maintaining scientific rigor in bias detection and measurement.

**Target Audience:** AI researchers, compliance teams, product leaders, and regulators who need to assess and monitor bias in LLM deployments.

## 2. Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Bias Detection:** Systematically identify 10 core cognitive biases across multiple LLM providers
- **Quantitative Measurement:** Provide normalized bias scores with statistical significance testing
- **Longitudinal Tracking:** Monitor bias drift and changes over time across model versions
- **Real-time Reporting:** Generate immediate bias assessment reports with trend analysis
- **Multi-modal Analysis:** Support both multiple-choice and free-text response analysis

### Secondary Goals
- **Cross-model Comparison:** Enable comparative bias analysis across different LLM providers
- **Educational Foundation:** Provide bias explanations and context for non-experts
